# INITIAL SET UP

To run the build, you'll need to install some node modules.
Run the following in the top-level directory of the project:

    npm install

grunt requires that you install grunt-cli globally
to be able to use grunt from the command line. To install
grunt-cli do:

    npm install -g grunt-cli

You should then install the client-side dependencies into app/lib/:

  npm install -g bower
  bower install

Note that if you want to install the application to a Tizen device
as a wgt file, you will also need to install the sdb tool first.
This is available for various platforms from
http://download.tizen.org/tools/latest-release/.

Configure your package manager to use the appropriate repo from the
ones available and install sdb, e.g. for Fedora 17:

    $ REPO=http://download.tizen.org/tools/latest-release/Fedora_17/tools.repo
    $ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo $REPO
    $ sudo yum install sdb

# WHERE'S THE APP?

There are a few options for running the application:

*   Open app/index.html in a browser (there's no requirement to
    run a build before you can run the app).

*   Build the files for the Chrome extension with:

        grunt crx

    then load the build/crx directory as an unpacked extension in Chrome
    developer mode. (The build can't currently make full .crx packages.)
